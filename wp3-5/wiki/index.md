Task 3.5 Security Architecture (University of Oxford):

The security architecture will build upon several key components: the
BONDI model [BOND09a], the\
Advanced Trusted Environment [OMTP09], and relevant W3C standards, but
in order to deliver the seamless\
interoperability - one might say intertrustability - these must be
integrated in a coherent manner. Key elements of\
this task are:

-   Integration of a secure execution model - with or without a trusted
    environment in the platform.
-   User-centric privacy control: ability to manage this through various
    interfaces; option to outsource it to a service provider, security
    specialist (e.g. anti-virus company), or community effort - or some
    combination of these.
-   Modal separation of work and personal data. Remote security controls
    for work data in particular.
-   Data (physical) locations; when and which data should be encrypted
    and when not, which may incorporate key-Management and trusted
    entities.
-   Models of local and remote access control to data and APIs.
-   Identity and authentication: durable models which work on many
    platforms.
-   Robustness in the face of (distributed) denial of service attacks
    (and mitigation against unwitting participation).
-   This architecture must be designed to be simple enough to be
    comprehensible - otherwise a loss of security results - and yet
    customizable to a very large range of applications and use cases.
    Clearly, it will be driven by the project use cases in the first
    instance. In addition, the architecture must be compatible with
    cloud security models arising from the Cloud Security Alliance and
    others. The security architecture will be permanently updated
    according to internal and external feedback and evaluations to
    improve the security framework.

The result of this task (to be provided in Deliverables D03.5 and D03.6)
will comprise:

-   Description of security model for webinos, showing how it integrates
    with webinos core and component architecture
-   Development guidance/best practice in webinos security (technical,
    organisational, and user guidance)
-   Framework for security evaluation

The following project partners will participate in this task.

ERCIM, University of Oxford, TIS, BMW F+T, SEMCA, Samsung, Polito,
DOCOMO, Impleo.
