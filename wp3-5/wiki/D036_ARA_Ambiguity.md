Ambiguity Analysis[Â¶](#Ambiguity-Analysis)
------------------------------------------

Based on our review of the webinos software architecture, we have
defined 7 architectural patterns that characterise the webinos attack
surface. For brevity, these are defined within the appendix, but are
summarised in the table below:

  Architectural pattern       Description                                                            Components                                                                                                         No. of assets

Based on both the pattern specifications and the damage effort ratio
formula defined the methodology, the quantitative attack surface of
webinos is summarised in the below table:

  Architectural pattern       DER\_m   DER\_c   DER\_i
  --------------------------- -------- -------- --------
  Context Policy Management   1.2      6.1      28.6
  NFC                         1.4      4        39.5
  PZH Authentication          9.6      6.1      29.7
  PZP Enrolment               11.2     5        16.6
  TV Service Discovery        3.7      4.2      29
  Widget Processing           1.1      1        22.9
  Widget Rendering            2.8      2        28.6

At a one-day workshop held in Berlin in August 2012, the leaf obstacles
resulting from the attack resistance analysis were reviewed and, based
on these, 71 mitigating requirements were elicited. Each requirement was
analysed to determine its affected components and whether these were
adequately addressed by the webinos software architecture. A summary of
this analysis is documented in the table below:
