Outline of requirements[¶](#Outline-of-requirements)
----------------------------------------------------

-   *Remote management provisioning* - "webinos shall facilitate the
    provisioning of remote webinos components necessary to enable
    personal device management"
-   *Personal device management* - "The webinos runtime shall include
    interfaces to allow end-users to manage the interactions between
    their personal devices."
-   *Application data synchronisation management* - "webinos shall allow
    users to manage applications which synchronise their data with other
    webinos devices."
-   *Policy management* - "webinos shall allow users to view and manage
    application policies."
-   *Access control log* - "webinos shall allow access control decisions
    to be logged."

This justifies that webinos should be able to do the following from a
PZH web interface:

-   Revocation (see earlier sections)
-   Remote wiping of application data

In addition, we can consider the following:

-   intrusion detection
-   "phone home" functionality
-   personal zone hub migration between farms

<!-- -->

    This section should clearly delineate between functionality we want and functionality we have already implemented
