Instructions[¶](#Instructions)
------------------------------

-   The mapping consists of a table with 4 columns: requirements name
    (first column in the excel sheet attached to the page), API name
    (from <http://dev.webinos.org/specifications/new/> ), Interface and
    method name (both from the API itself). The latter only have to be
    defined if this is possible.
-   If the requirement is not fulfilled by any API, fill out the last 3
    columns with a hyphen
-   If it is unclear whether there is an API, interface or method, use a
    question mark.
-   If you're unsure about the API, append the API name with a question
    mark.
-   A requirement can be fulfilled by more then one API, feel free to
    add multiple lines for a requirement.
