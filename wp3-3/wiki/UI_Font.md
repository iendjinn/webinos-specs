Font-size increase on the TV/Vehicle[¶](#Font-size-increase-on-the-TVVehicle)
=============================================================================

Text is one of the primary content types. It is important for it to be
easy for the user to consume it, without having to strain his eyes.

### Rendering rules[¶](#Rendering-rules)

We are used to watching content on desktop, tablet and mobile screens.
These have similar, high resolutions optimized for the distance at which
we view the content. TV's and automotive screens aren't optimized for
this. Text has to be displayed bigger on these screens to be readable by
the end user.

#### PC and Tablet[¶](#PC-and-Tablet)

No adaptation is needed.

#### Smartphone[¶](#Smartphone)

No adaptation is needed.

#### In-vehicle system and TV.[¶](#In-vehicle-system-and-TV)

A procentual increase in font-size throughout the application is
required. This will make sure the font-size remain the same relative to
each other.

### Code example[¶](#Code-example)

This is a very generic adaptation rule, no relevant code example can be
given here.
