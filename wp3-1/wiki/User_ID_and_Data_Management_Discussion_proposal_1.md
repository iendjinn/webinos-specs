PZH = Personal Zone Hub: combines the functionality of **registrar** and
**Identity Provider** (**IDP**) for the purpose of communicating among
own devices in the own personal zone and across personal zones of other
users\
PZP = Personal Zone Proxy: a proxy of the PZH in the case the PZH cannot
be accessed
