March 21st 2011 - Telco on Merging Context Management Context-Driven Content Adaptation[¶](#March-21st-2011-Telco-on-Merging-Context-Management-Context-Driven-Content-Adaptation)
==================================================================================================================================================================================

AGENDA POINTS[¶](#AGENDA-POINTS)
--------------------------------

-   Discussion on whether to merge Context Management and Context-Driven
    Content Adaptation under a new Area entitled “Context Awareness”
-   Action points for merging (or after not merging)

\*George (NTUA)\
\*Radek (AntennaVolantis)\
\*Hans (AmbieSense)\
\*Heiko, Dieter (IBBT)

MINUTES[¶](#MINUTES)
--------------------

Radek: content adaptation is something quite clear and straightforward
in its objectives. Context management is still in-concrete.

Hans: no problem merging, maybe “keeping them together until we see they
should be separated” is a good approach. Having also a bigger team may
give us bigger capacity to contribute - George also concurs.

Radek: having a bigger team should not only be the primary reason for
merging.

Heiko: Content adaptation is probably the “primary client” of the
context management area.

George: Context Management will provide the necessary information to the
content adaptation, so in a potential context awareness area the two
existing areas (context management, content adaptation) would do
complimentary things.

Heiko: teams with 2-3 partners are too small to make an impact.

Hans: we should merge under Context Awareness and Adaptation. George
agrees. Heiko agrees. Radek: we should see the scope of the new area
before merging.

**Proposition:** Start with a new wiki page on Context Awareness and
Adaptation by concentrating all requirements and co-shaping Scope. NTUA
to start on that asap.

*note1: for all requirements try and make a note on to what they pertain
(content adaptation, context retrieval, context sharing). And also try
to provide reference and state of the art section.*

*note2: Analytics could also be a potential (“client”) area of the broad
Context Awareness-Adaptation area. GeorgeG have a call with GeorgeV on
that.*
